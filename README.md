# Thomas' homework 8 repository 

In this repository, you will find the contents for my assignment submission. The goal of the assignment was to update the BC Liquor store app we explored in class with 3 features.

Updates I included were:

- Adding more descriptive headers throughout to make the app more user friendly
- Updated the units to C$ as the target audience is likely living in Canada
- Increased the price range to $1000 (France had an option for $999!)
- Allowed users to select multiple types of alcohol
- Made data in table order from highest to lowest price by default (encouraging higher sales?)
- Gave option for users to order results from lowest to highest
- Indicated to users how many results they obtained
- Gave users an option to save obtained results
- Made colour palette in plot colour-blind-friendly and reflective of alcohol type
- Added an image to encourage responsible drinking!
